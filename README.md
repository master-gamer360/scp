# (all players have 3 lives.)

the players all get an envelope at their doors during a tough time, the players can't find jobs
because they're all framed for murder. The envelope says:


#
### "Dear {name}, we have kept an eye on you and we know that you've been wrongfully framed for those charges,
### We would like to offer you an opportunity to start fresh if you agree to work at our place.

### for the protection of all humanity and more, 

### -the SCP foundation."

the players first meet each other during their "job interview", (here, they'll all introduce each other or smth)

after some time, a scientist-looking guy comes and introduces himself as "dr Liam Neeson"

he invites a player to his office (the players will all have to roll a dice, whoever rolls the lowest will go with him, if anyone rolls a 1, they'll have to go.
this will repeat for all interviews)

once all players have been interviewed, he gives everyone a debrief on their first "assignment"
he says "All of you pass, congratulations. (in a sarcastic way) your first assignment is to clean some *pause* stuff"

he directs all of the players to a cell with white walls, there's blood and faeces everywhere and next to one wall stands a lifesized peanut-looking statue

he then turns to the players and says "that...is scp 173 also known as 'the statue' or 'the peanut'"
